# Hello Triangle

This project, in pure jogl, contains the following:

* [HelloTriangle](https://github.com/elect86/helloTriangle/tree/master/HelloTriangle/src/helloTriangle), showing the rendering of a rotating triangle <a href="url"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/i22AI9I.png" width="200" ></a>

* [HelloTexture](https://github.com/elect86/helloTriangle/tree/master/HelloTriangle/src/helloTexture), showing the rendering of a rotating square with a texture <a href="url"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HbnqqX5.png" width="200" ></a> 


Steps:

* download [`jogamp-all-platforms.7z`](https://jogamp.org/deployment/jogamp-current/archive/jogamp-all-platforms.7z) and extract it wherever you like. This is the place where the jogl dependencies will be searched.
* set up your [favourite IDE](https://jogamp.org/wiki/index.php/Setting_up_a_JogAmp_project_in_your_favorite_IDE) creating a library and pointing it to `jogamp-all-platforms\jar\gluegen-rt.jar` and `jogamp-all-platforms\jar\jogl-all.jar`. You are stronly advised to not move those jar since they need to lie in the same place as the natives of your platform are.
* clone, download, copy/paste the code or do whatever you like with the code of the samples.
* run it and enjoy the OpenGL acceleration on java  :sunglasses:
